## Workshop-1 Binary Classification with Neural Networks on the Census Income Dataset
## Name: Ashwin Akash M
## Reference Number:212223230024
## Aim
The aim of this project is to develop a neural network model capable of performing binary classification on the Census Income dataset to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year. This is achieved by training the model on demographic and employment-related features provided in the dataset.

## Algorithmic Steps (Theoretical Framework)
### Problem Definition
Formulate the task as a binary classification problem.
Target variable: income (binary â€” <=50K or >50K).
### Data Collection
Use the UCI Adult (Census Income) Dataset.
Contains features such as age, education, occupation, hours worked per week, etc.
### Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (e.g., replace or remove entries with ?).
Encode categorical features using methods like:
One-hot encoding
Label encoding (if appropriate)
Normalize/standardize numerical features to ensure effective training.
Split the dataset into training and test sets (commonly 80/20 or 70/30).
### Model Design
Design a feedforward neural network with:
Input layer matching number of features.
One or more hidden layers (with activation functions like ReLU).
Output layer with a sigmoid activation for binary classification.
### Model Compilation
Choose appropriate loss function: Binary Crossentropy.
Select an optimizer: e.g., Adam or SGD.
Specify metrics: typically accuracy.
### Model Training
Train the model on the training dataset for a number of epochs.
Use batch processing to improve performance.
Implement validation to monitor overfitting.
### Model Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model on the test set.
Metrics to consider:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
AUC-ROC Curve
### Prediction
Use the model to predict income category for new, unseen individuals.
### Conclusion
Analyze model performance.
Identify strengths and weaknesses.
Discuss potential improvements or real-world applications.
